`!begin <event id>`
>  Confirm creation of games for the given event id. _Requires the "SpellBot Admin" role._

`!event <column 1> <column 2> ... [tags: tag-1 tag-2] [msg: Hello world!]`
>  Create many games in batch from an attached CSV data file. _Requires the "SpellBot Admin" role._
>
> For example, if your event is for a Modern tournement you might attach a CSV file with a comment like `!event Player1Username Player2Username`. This would assume that the players' discord user names are found in the "Player1Username" and "Player2Username" CSV columns. The game size is deduced from the number of column names given, so we know the games created in this example are `size:2`.
